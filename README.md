# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets
 The goal for this project is to analyze data to understand what kinds of app profiles are likely to attract more users and are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.<br>
 The analysis was performed using Basic Python Data Structures such as (Python Lists, Dictionaries and Tuples) without the use of Advanced Data Structures such as (Pandas-Dataframe and Numpy-arrays).
 **Check out the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/The-PhanTom999/Google_Play-and-App-Store-Analysis/blob/38faa1c9a96a34d91c6d14589af2e12092a20b1f/Notebook.ipynb)**

### After the Analysis i was able to come to a conclusion that:

Taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets, but these markets are already full of libraries so some special features may need to be added to the app besides the raw version of the book, which might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, or a forum where people can discuss the book, etc.
